    "For this assignment, you're going to add it to the cmse202-s20-turnin repository you created in class so that you can track your progress on the assignment and preserve the final version that you turn in. In order to do this you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Navigate to your `cmse202-s20-turnin` repository and create a new directory called `hw-04`.\n",
    "* Move this notebook into that new directory in your repository, then add it and commit it to your repository.\n",
    " * Finally, to test that everything is working, \"git push\" the file so that it ends up in your GitHub repository.\n",

    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the `cmse202-s20-turnin` repository under the `hw-04` directory that you just created. Periodically, you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish. It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."
